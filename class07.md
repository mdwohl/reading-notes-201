# Reading Notes - Class 07

### Article - Domain Modeling

*Domain modeling* is a way to approach solving problems by creating models that help you verify that you understand the operative problem.

It also functions like a workflow, or suggested workflow.

Domain modeling suggests separating a multifacted projectinto self-contained objects. Break things into smaller pieces. "Focus on doing one job well"

Think of how this might apply to Lab 06. This is a very complex assignment. How might it be broken down into parts that are simple and repeatable?

### HTML Ch. 06 - Tables

*Tables* represent information as a grid. Think of the standings for baseball teams on the sports page. Tables at their most basic consisit of *rows* and *cells*. *Rows* can span multiple columns in HTML -- think of a schedule in which an event takes multiple hours.

Tables can also be formatted with head, body, foot.

### JS Ch. 03 - Functions, Methods, and Objects

*Functions* are what JS uses to group related statements together in the completion of a signle task. Functions take *parameters* to do their work -- parameters are the pieces of information required to do a job. Think of a function for area: length x width would be the parameters.

*Objects* are larger, and incorporate variables along with functions to represent something in the world. Variables used in an object are known as *properties*. Functions in an object are known as *methods*.

Our browser uses objects that represent what we see in the browser, and what is loaded into the window.

Many of the things we use in JS in class often (string, number, math date) are built-in Javascript objects. JS has many of these and they help you write scripts.

Arrays and objects can work together to handle very complex data sets and accomplish complicated tasks.
