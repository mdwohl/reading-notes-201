# Reading Notes: Class 11

### HTML Book Ch. 16 - Images

CSS can be used to control the sizing and alignment as well as display of your image. This can help to keep things consistent and easy to rearrange if necessary. CSS can size image by pixel width x height, but also more generically by small, medium, large, etc.

Images can be aligned, and are frequently set to a float class right 'align-right' or 'align-left'. If an image is to be centered, that is either done with setting the text-align property of the container or the margin property of auto of the image itself.

Background images: keep in mind they are often the last thing to load, and can be large. Not paying attention to the size of a bg image can cause a page to load slowly. From a design standpoint, contrast and gradient can be used to make background elements more easily readable relative to text elements.

Images can give the impression of interactivity with rollovers that change a button when the mouse is over the element, or sprites -- a single image being used for different parts of an interface (like a block of buttons). These are very common features in ecommerce. Sprites break up an image into individual parts to save time on reload.

Beyond the content and structure of websites, execution is important when considering how to connect with users and traffic. Analytics can reveal user trends; SEO can help search engines connect users with your site more efficiently.

1. Page Title
2. URL/Address
3. Headings
4. Text
5. Link Text
6. Img alt text
7. Page descriptions in head/metadata.

In determining what keywords are besxt, be collaborative. User surveys can help tremendously.

*Analyitcs* will give you data about your users. Google Analytics is a free service that is very powerful. Your page sends data to Google, and then Google provices an interface that gives you info about how users interact with your site. Analytics can help reveal where users are coming from (on the web or geographically), what visitors look at; how long do they spend on different parts of your site, etc.
