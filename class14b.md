### What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team

This article touches on the experience of Julia Rozovsky, who took a winding path through her education and career. After research and consulting, she started working on her MBA. 

Many business schools, according to the article, use study groups to foster group dynamics, relationship building, and and to mirror the social dynamics of the workplace. Rozovsky, however, felt it didn't work, and made her and her groupmates competitive, stressed, and on edge. She found stronger connections in a "case competition" group, a voluntary extracirricular in which participants attempt to find solutions for real problems in the business world. That group clicked almost immediately. Though her mandatory study group dissolved after the semester, her case team lasted for years voluntarily. This begged the question of why one group worked and the other faltered.

Companies are very concerned with answering this question. Many studies support the notion that teams achieve better results, and that employees are happier in groups. Companies have taken notice and spent untold sums of money trying to figure out how to engineer group bonds and the associated productivity. Despite the studying of troves of data, patterns were extremely hard to tease out. Nothing showed that particular personality types or backgrounds made any difference.

What became clear was that groups adhered to different norms, and recognizing those norms was what fostered team cohesion. The cohesion seems to relate to a group identity, and reserachers started to wonder whether or not there is an emergent collective group intelligence when things gel. Through testing the ability to accomplish various tasks, researchers seem to find that teams that succeed at one thing succeed at others, and vice versa; teams that fail often fail at other things. The distinguishing element is how teammates treat one another --  this "brings out the best" in everyone. Having the right norms played to certain teams strengths, taking advantage of different individual capacities.

Two "good team" behaviors were shared. On good teams, voices were equally heard. The distribution of who spoke and for how long was reasonably well balanced. They found that conversely, one-sided groups diminished the collective intelligence. The good teams also exhibited high levels of personal intuition -- social skills, essentially. They displayed empathy and sensitivity to cues verbal and nonverbal. As you might expect, this was not as present on the teams that failed. It's interesting to note that both types of teams were composed of people who were highly talented and focused; their innate abilities as groups were comparible. But their norms and cohesion were vastly different.
