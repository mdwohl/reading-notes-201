# Reading Notes: Class 04

### HTML Ch. 4 - Links

*links* move the web. One page to another, to email, within a page, new windows, etc. Key function of what the web does

Within a site, you only need an '<a>' to move; href used for external. '/' indicates dirs, '..' like the shell for parent dir.

ID attributes with '#' can be used to define page sections and link there (think a long article).

### HTML Ch. 15 - Layout

To refresh, CSS treats elements in HTML as if they are their own boxes. *Parent elements* are boxes that contain other block-level elements.

**Positions of Elemenets**

* Normal flow -- block level elements on new line. Each new item appears below previous item.

* Relative positioning -- shifts top, right, bottom, left of where element would be in normal flow.

* Absolute position -- takes element out of normal flow.

* Fixed position --  type of absolute position that positions with regard to browser window, rather than containing element.

* Floating element -- takes element out of flow, and positions to far left or right of container.

Elements can also overlap. Floats can create layouts with multiple columns.

*Fixed width* vs *liquid* layouts: fixed determines a width in pixels. Designers usually keep pages within 960-1000 pixels and indicate what a site is about within the top 600 pixels so users can see if it's relevant without scrolling. Liquid uses percentages to fit size of screen.

### JS Ch. 3  - Functions, Methods, and Objects

*Functions* group multiple statements toward the goal of accomplishing a task. Functions are 'called' by using the function name in code after they are declared.

Some functions need information to run -- this info is referred to as a parameter, which can function like a variable.

Some functions return information after being called in code. They can also return multiple values using an array.
