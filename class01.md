# Reading Notes: Class 01

### HTML Ch. 01 - Structure

**HTML** = hyper text markup language. Hypertext means it can link, markup language means text can be annotated. The tags we add are markup.

**Elements** live inside of **tags** -- an *opening* and *closing* tag. *Attributes* tell us more about elements, appearing on the oepning tag and consisting of a *name* and *value*.

'<p lang="en-us">' lang is attribute name, en-us is the attribute value.

**Body** contains everything shown in the browser.
**Head** contains information about the page itself.
**Title** displays in the top of browser or in tab.

### HTML Ch. 02 - Extra Markup

There are different versions of HTML with different capabilities. HTML 4, XHTML 10, and HTML 5 are primary ones to be aware of -- HTML 5 is the newest.

As in previous class, remember comments can be made in HTML with '<!-- -->', as in '<DOCTYPE html>'.

**ID attribute** is a type of global attribute, that can be used on any element. It identifies that attribute from others on the page.
**Class attribute** can be used on elements that share values. Several class attributes can be used if you separate the lass names with a space.
**Block elements** appear to start on a new line.
**Inline elements** appear as if they were a continuing sentance.
**div** can be used to group sets of elements together in a single box.
**Span** functions similarly with inline element grouping.
**iframes** little windows for viewing other pages. Think scrollable maps.
**meta** info about pages that is not displayed in browser.

### HTML Ch. 17 - HTML5 Layout

HTML5 introduces new layout elements -- many '<div>' elements have been replaced when compared with traditional HTML.

**Headers & footers** used for main header/footer that appear top & bottom of every page. Can also be used for an individual article or section element.
**Nav** contains navigation blocks -- links, etc.
**Article** section of  page that could stand alone, helps with search features. Often, multiple articles are used together (separating content from comments, etc)
**Aside** depending whether or not it is in an article, can have different functions. Inside an article, contains info relevant but not essential (glossary, quote). Outside of an article, info within is related to entire page.
**Section** can be used to group related content, and would usually be grouped with a distinct heading.
**Heading group** can group together same heading elements so that they function as one.
**Figures** and **figcaption** are used for iamges, videos, graphs, diagrams, etc.
**Div** still used in HTML5, but can be used when there is no specific element to group with.
**HTML shim and shiv** used to help older browsers understand HTML5. Internet Explorer is especially problematic. This tells the browser what elements are block level.

### HTML Ch. 18 - Process and Design

It's important to design a website with a target user/audience in mind. Age range, where they are, interests, income, education, et cetera can all help tailor content. The target can be either individuals, or companies and groups.

Important questions:
* why do people visit?
* what are visitors' goals?
* what info do visitors need?
* how often do people visit?

**Site maps** are used to help plan and sort site content.
**Wireframes** are sketches of info on each page.

Appropriate messaging, grouping, and use of visual hierarchy helps communicate what is essential to users.
